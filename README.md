## **_JavaDocs:_**

### Read the Javadoc for the main Service API: [MailSenderService API](https://javadoc.io/doc/best.skn/skn-spring-mail/latest/best/skn/mail/services/MailSenderService.html)

### Read the Javadoc for the main Entity API: [MailSenderRequestBody API](https://javadoc.io/doc/best.skn/skn-spring-mail/latest/best/skn/mail/entities/MailSenderRequestBody.html)

&nbsp;

## **_Introduction:_**

### This is a simple Java Reactive Spring Boot Library for sending mails

### I made this library so that I can use it in most of my spring boot reactive projects without writing the same codes over and over again

### The main API Classes of this library are `MailSenderService` which has 4 methods to send mails & `MailSenderRequestBody` which holds the blueprint for `@RequestBody` annotated params in controllers

&nbsp;

## **_Details:_**

### **(1) `MailSenderService` Class:**

- It needs to be instantiated first
- It must be used in controller POST requests
- It has 4 methods to send mails
- These 4 methods throw `MessagingException` if sending error occurs
- The modes to send mails:
  - Basic Mail
  - Basic Mail With Attachment
  - Mail With HTML Template
  - Mail With HTML Template & Attachment

### **(2) `MailSenderRequestBody` Class:**

- It is the blueprint for `@RequestBody` annotated params in controllers
- In controller POST requests, the request body must match the blueprint of it

&nbsp;

## **_Requirements:_**

- 💀 Minimum Java Version: `21`
- 💀 Minimum Maven Version: `3.9.6`
- 💀 Minimum Spring Boot (Reactive/Web Flux) Version: `3.2.3`

&nbsp;

## **_Usage:_**

### For `Maven`, inside `dependencies` tag of `pom.xml`, copy the following

> ```xml
> <dependency>
> 	<groupId>best.skn</groupId>
> 	<artifactId>skn-spring-mail</artifactId>
> 	<version>1.2.2</version>
> </dependency>
> ```

### Write the following in the terminal

> ```zsh
> mvn install
> ```

### Inside your Java Code, import the package like this for `MailSenderService`

> ```java
> import best.skn.mail.services.MailSenderService;
> ```

### First create a configuration class, and construct a bean

> ```java
> @Configuration
> public class MailSenderConfiguration {
> 	@Bean
> 	MailSenderService mailSenderService() {
> 		MailSenderService mailSender = new MailSenderService();
> 		return mailSender;
> 	}
> }
> ```

### Inside your Java Code, import the package like this for `MailSenderRequestBody`

> ```java
> import best.skn.mail.entities.MailSenderRequestBody;
> ```

### In controller POST requests, use it like the following (Just an example)

> ```java
> @Autowired
> private MailSenderService mailSender;
>
> @PostMapping
> public Mono<String> sendMail(@RequestBody MailSenderRequestBody requestBody) throws MessagingException {
>  	return this.mailSender.sendMail(
>  		requestBody.getFrom(),
>  		requestBody.getTo(),
>  		requestBody.getSubject(),
>  		requestBody.getBody()
>  	);
> }
> ```

### When requesting the API from `Postman` or `Frontend Framework`, the request body `json` format can be like the following

> ```json
> {
> 	"from": "<sender email address>",
> 	"to": "<receiver email address>",
> 	"subject": "<mail subject>",
> 	"body": "<mail body>",
> 	"filePath": "<attachment file path>",
> 	"templateName": "<html template name>"
> }
> ```

### In the `json` request body, the fields: `from`, `to`, `subject` & `body` are hard requirements to pass

### For `filePath` & `templateName` fields, if any of those are not sent as they are not hard requirements, the default value sent to the API will be `null`
